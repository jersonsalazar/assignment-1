      The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a member of the genus Panthera 
      and the largest living cat species native to Asia. It has a 
      powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail 
      and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is 
      traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though 
      some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and 
      the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
