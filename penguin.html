      Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family
      Spheniscidae of the order Sphenisciformes. They live almost 
      exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the 
      Gal√°pagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted
      for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark
      and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed 
      on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they 
      catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin
      has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.
